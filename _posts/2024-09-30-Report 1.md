## Upcycling of ABS/PC Blends: A Review of Studies and the Analysis of Optimal Ratios
### Introduction
Recycling and optimizing the use of polymers, particularly in the context of polymer blends like Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) and Polycarbonate (PC), are pivotal challenges in materials science. This report provides an analysis based on available research articles and sources concerning two interrelated topics: the upcycling of ABS/PC polymer blends and the effects of varying ABS/PC ratios on material properties.
ABS and PC are both significant thermoplastic polymers with distinct properties that make them suitable for various industrial applications. ABS is recognized for its mechanical strength and resistance, making it ideal for applications such as electronic housings and automotive components. On the other hand, PC is valued for its clarity and impact resistance, commonly used in products requiring transparency and durability.
It is important to note that this report is based solely on the articles and sources reviewed, and there may be additional research and literature that has not been covered. A supplementary Excel file is attached to this report, listing the sources that have been reviewed and providing links to these references for further exploration.
Before delving into the specific research articles and analyses, it is essential to first review the fundamental characteristics of ABS and PC (table 1). Understanding these materials' basic properties will provide a solid foundation for appreciating their roles in advanced and emerging technologies, and how they are utilized in various applications.
