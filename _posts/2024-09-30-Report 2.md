Introduction to Part 2:
In the first part of this report, we explored the challenges and advancements in the upcycling of ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) and PC (Polycarbonate) polymer blends, and analyzed how varying ABS/PC ratios affect material properties. This foundational review set the stage for a deeper examination of the experimental approaches and findings related to these polymers.
